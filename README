This is release 3.4 of sash, my stand-alone shell for Linux.

The purpose of this program is to make system recovery possible in
many cases where there are missing shared libraries or executables.
It does this by firstly being linked statically, and secondly by
including versions of many of the standard utilities within itself.
Read the sash.1 documentation for more details.

This version has the "-ar" built-in command for extracting files
from archive files.  This is used for unpacking Debian packages.
Thanks to Aaron R. Crane for donating the code for this command
(highly modified by me).

Type "make install" to build and install the program and man page.

Some warning messages may appear when compiling cmds.c under Linux from
the mount.h and fs.h include files.  These warnings can be ignored.
